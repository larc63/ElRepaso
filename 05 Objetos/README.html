        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <p>the inline keyword is a compiler directive that is a recommendation only. The compiler may ignore your request and compile the function normally resulting in function calls anyway. C++ makes use of the following keywords that apply to storage classes: static - identifiers declared with static are allocated when the program starts and deallocated when the program execution ends. Declaring a variable as static in a function means that the variable will retain its value between calls to the function. extern - used to declare an object that is defined in another translation unit of within the enclosing scope but has an external linkage. thread_local - declares that the identifier is only accessible on the thread in which it is created. This prevents sharing of the identifier across multiple threads in the same application. This is part of the C++11 standard.
